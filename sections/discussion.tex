As has been demonstrated in this paper, our system is efficacious in 3D object 
reconstruction. Our system is able to reconstruct closed object models on sequences for which an alternative, state of 
the art system \cite{Ren2013} fails to converge to any reasonable solution. In addition, we show robust odometry on an 
established SLAM benchmark, despite the difficulty of tracking only the objects surface vs the entire scene. Finally,
in spite of our use of ICP for pose estimation with ambiguities, our system is capable of robustly reconstructing a 
variety of objects.
