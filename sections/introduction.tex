Dense SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) has proven to be an effective paradigm for the reconstruction of moderately-sized scenes,
with much recent research on the topic driven by the availability of inexpensive, consumer-grade depth sensing equipment\cite{Newcombe2011,Niessner2013,Prisacariu2014}. 
However, a prominent problem within the dense SLAM paradigm is that of tracking camera motion with respect to the scene. Two common approaches exploit geometry and texture 
respectively. However, there are failure cases in both approaches when there is a lack of geometrical or texture based features to which the system must track against. 
Common issues range from tracking drift, often caused by ambiguity, to complete tracker failure. In addition, the error incurred during loop closure events can be detrimental 
to tracking quality with the aforementioned approaches. Failure cases for such approaches are only exacerbated when there is 
less data to track with/against, as is the case with the tracking of an objects pose w.r.t the camera(the inverse to the camera tracking problem).

As object reconstruction can be seen as a smaller-scale equivalent of the scene-based dense reconstruction problem, it too is prone to the
tracking drift and loop closure problem, sometimes to a prohibitive level. As previously highlighted, the tracking of an objects pose w.r.t the camera is also affected 
by geometric or texture based ambiguities, caused by a much more focused domain of the data available to the tracking algorithm. For example, when reconstructing an 
entire scene, all of the data in the current and previous frames is available. When tracking solely an object this is not the case.

In this paper, we present a probabilistic object reconstruction framework for in-hand reconstruction of rigid objects based on object
appearances. The framework facilitates the correction of camera tracking drift by representing the object to be reconstructed as a
collection of overlapping subsegments such that deformations may be inferred to keep the subsegments aligned, resulting in a consistent
overall model. We utilise a volumetric representation for each of these object subsegments, as with many larger scale reconstruction
systems\cite{Kahler2016}. Each voxel in the subsegments has additional appearance posterior information pertaining to the voxel's membership of the object.
Over time, multiple volumes containing both surface and probabilistic appearance information are maintained and manipulated to yield a
robust and temporally-consistent model.

In addition, to further increase the robustness of the object tracking, a novel tracking procedure is used, utilising appearance features
in image space. Finally, we optimise for the optimum object shape within a max-flow framework.

We demonstrate an improvement in object reconstruction quality by performing online transformations to the aforementioned subsegments to counteract inconsistencies 
caused by drift in the object pose tracking process.
