The availability of high-quality, consumer-grade depth sensing equipment has motivated much research in dense SLAM systems for
object reconstruction. Though much progress has been made, the well-known loop closure problem remains an active target of research.
In this paper, we present an object reconstruction system that is capable of counteracting camera tracking drift and detecting loop
closures to achieve high-quality reconstructions.
We demonstrate that our novel correction algorithm is able to reduce tracking drift, detect loop closures and increase overall
object reconstruction quality.
