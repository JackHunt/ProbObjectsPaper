The availability of high quality, consumer grade, depth sensing equipment has motivated much research in dense SLAM systems for
object reconstruction. Though much progress has been made, the well known loop closure problem is still an active area of research.
In this paper we present an object reconstruction system that is capable of counteracting camera tracking drift and detecting loop
closures, such that high quality reconstructions can be yielded even with a high level of interaction.
We demonstrate that our novel correction algorithm is able to reduce tracking drift, detect loop closures and increase overall
object reconstruction quality.
